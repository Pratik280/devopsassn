## Serverless

- We founded the concept of serverless on the following tenets: no server management, pay-for-value services, continuous scaling, and built-in fault tolerance. When adopting a serverless service or building a serverless architecture, these ideals are fundamental to serverless strategy.

Questions to answer
1. Where do we deploy the application?
1. What kind of server ? What OS ?
1. How de we take care of scaling the application ?
1. How do we ensure availability ?
